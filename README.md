# Turingoat

I developed this project for a group of guys with the ambition to become a startup. 
The purpose of their project reegards the design and development of a station for mantaining, parking and charging bikes and scooters. 
The idea is that the user with a simple card or a smartphone simply unlock a door by apporaching it to a reader. In this way the user can use the tools the station is equipped with.
