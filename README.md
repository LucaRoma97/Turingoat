# Turingoat

I developed this project for a group of guys that has the ambition to become a startup. I helped them just to stisfy my desire of developing without charging anything. 
The purpose of their project concerns the design and development of a station for mantaining, parking and charging of bikes and scooters. 
The idea is that the user with a simple card or a smartphone simply unlock a door by apporaching it to a reader. In this way the user can use the tools the station is equipped with.
